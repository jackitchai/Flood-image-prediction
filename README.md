# Flood image prediction with Deep learning
This is my senior project, to predicting flood image by using the 3DDR_UNet (3D Dimension Reducer) model with satellite images obtained from Google Earth Engine.

## This repo contains
1. **GGE_collect_data.py** --> file to collect data from google earth engine
2. **GGE_visualization.py** --> javascript to use on GGE platform
3. **model.py** --> file to train the model
4. **Senior project_report.pdf** --> my senior report
5. **Presentation_EE_499.pdf** -->my sernior presentation 

## To get start
### 1.Google earth engine
- Check image before download from GGE Visualization and download data by GGE collect data

Phra Nakorn Sri Ayuttaya Flood image during Q4 2022

### 2.Train and test model from 3DDR U-Net

- Ubon Ratchatani predicted image with flooding image 5-day lag
